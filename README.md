Build the project for use on your phone.

### Usage

Point the camera at a [play listed here](http://rnplay.org/plays) or [create one](http://rnplay.org/plays/new). The app should load on your phone.

You can start over by shaking the phone and hitting Reload, or quitting and starting the app again.
